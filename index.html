            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>I was a poor Student in high school and preferred hanging out with my friends and smoking marijuana to studying. Walt, whom I always call "Mr. White", was my chemistry teacher and flunked me in his class. Walt himself later says that he never thought I would amount to much, although my mother recalls that Walt "must have seen some potential in me; he really tried to motivate me. He was one of the few teachers who cared. Despite my poor academic standing, I was able to graduate, with Walt present on stage when he received my diploma.</p>
